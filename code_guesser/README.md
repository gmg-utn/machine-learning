# Needed to play

- the notebook itself, here as `code_guesser.ipynb`

- a virtualenv with dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

- the dump with all source files:

    - the dump itself:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/hpgg0ktz9ib0xdx/dump-codes.tar.xz?dl=0

    - the list of quantities per code type in that dump: http://linkode.org/#1dAdK1HnxtnQqr9aQG3GD7 

(probably you will want to change in the notebook which code types to include)
